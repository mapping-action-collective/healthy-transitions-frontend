  "ABOUT_TEXT": "The Oregon Youth Resource Map is designed to help young people ages 16-25 and their allies connect to youth-serving resources, organizations and leadership opportunities. The map centers youth needs and voices, and includes services for health and mental healthcare, housing, education, and more. The Map began as a way to connect youth with mental health services, and has expanded to cover resources connected to health and wellness for youth and young adults. \n This tool was developed by young people with lived experience in mental health services/systems in our state. These young leaders convened as part of Healthy Transitions Oregon, a federal grant working to improve services for transition-age youth with significant mental health challenges. More about Healthy Transitions can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/grants/grant-announcements/sm-18-010.",
